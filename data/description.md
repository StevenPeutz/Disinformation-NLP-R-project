A previously made public dataset described in the following article:
Ahmed H, Traore I, Saad S. (2017) â€œDetection of Online Fake News Using N-Gram Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques. In: Traore I., Woungang I., Awad A. (eds) Intelligent, Secure, and Dependable Systems in Distributed and Cloud Environments. ISDDC 2017. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 10618. Springer, Cham (pp. 127-138).
Disinformation and propaganda cases collected by the EUvsDisinfo project. A project started in 2015 that identifies and fact checks disinformation cases originating from pro-Kremlin media that are spread across the EU.
The articles have all information except the actual text removed and are split up into a set with all the fake news / misinformation, and one with al the true articles.

_// For those only interested in Russian propaganda (and not so much misinformation in general), I have added the Russian propaganda in a separate csv called 'EXTRA_RussianPropagandaSubset.csv..'_
